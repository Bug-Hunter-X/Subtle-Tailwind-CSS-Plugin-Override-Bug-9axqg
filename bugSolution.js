```javascript
// bugSolution.js - Applying !important to resolve the issue (not ideal but shows a workaround)
// ... some Tailwind CSS classes
<div class="bg-gray-100 p-4">
  <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold">Uncommon Tailwind Bug - SOLVED</h1>
  <p class="text-gray-700">
    This div now has the correct gray background thanks to the applied !important flag. However, using !important should be used sparingly as it reduces maintainability.  A better solution would be to resolve the conflict with the conflicting plugin.
  </p>
</div>
