# Subtle Tailwind CSS Plugin Override Bug

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug that can occur when using Tailwind CSS with plugins. The problem involves a plugin that unintentionally overrides Tailwind's styling, leading to unexpected visual results.  The example showcases a div element that should have a gray background but does not due to a style conflict. The solution involves understanding the CSS specificity and potentially modifying the plugin or your Tailwind configuration.
